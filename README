greedyMapper
============

A simple program for centralizing distributed [libmapper](http://www.libmapper.org) network topologies.

This program is intended as a proof-of-concept to show that [libmapper](http://www.libmapper.org) can be used in
a centralized client-server-like mode if desired. On startup the program will reroute all existing libmapper
connections on the local network through itself while maintaining all specified signal processing. While running it
will continue to dynamically reroute any new mapping connections, and when terminated it will return the network to
it's previous distributed (peer-to-peer) state.
